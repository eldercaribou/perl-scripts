(Wikipedia) The user interface (of a computer program) refers to the
graphical, textual and auditory information the program presents to the user,
and the control sequences (such as keystrokes with the computer keyboard,
movements of the computer mouse, and selections with the touchscreen) the user
employs to control the program.
