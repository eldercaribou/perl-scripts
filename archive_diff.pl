=head1 NAME

archive_diff.pl

=head1 VERSION

The CVS version of this file is $Revision$. See the top of this file for
the author's version number.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<archive_diff.pl> compares the contents of two archives, checking for files
that are in one archive and not the other and vice versa.

=cut

package main;

=pod

=head2 Package Archive

The Archive object grabs information from an archive of some kind and allows
this information to be queried.  The L<Archive> object contains an
L<Archive::Attributes> object and a hash of L<Archive::File> objects keyed by
filename.

=cut

package Archive;

=pod 

=head2 Package Archive::Attributes

Contains attributes for an archive file.  Can be queried using the following
methods:

=head3 version

Version of the program that created this archive.  May or may not come from
the archive itself;  a asterisk B<*> denotes the version number of the program
on the system, as the archive it—ïelf does not hold any version information.

=cut

package Archive::Attributes;

=pod 

=head2 Package Archive::File

An object that holds information about a file in an archive.  You would most
likely create as many L<Archive::File> objects as you had individual files and
directories in an archive.  L<Archive::File> can be queried using the
following methods:

=head3 name

=head3 timestamp

=head3 usize

=head3 attributes

=cut

package Archive::File;

=pod
