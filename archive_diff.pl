=head1 NAME

B<archive_diff.pl> compares the contents of two archives, checking for files
that are in one archive and not the other and vice versa.

=head1 VERSION

The CVS version of this file is $Revision$. See the top of this file for
the author's version number.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 perl archive_diff.pl -1 first_filelist.txt -2 second_filelist.txt 

=head2 Package Archive

The Archive object grabs information from an archive of some kind and allows
this information to be queried.  The L<Archive> object has the following
attributes:

=over 5

=item attrib

The archive attributes.  Contained in an object of L<Archive::Attributes>
type.

=item filename 

The name of the archive file.  The file is checked to see if it exists and is
readable when an object is created from this class.

=item contents

A hash of L<Archive::File> objects keyed by filename.

has q(contents) => ( is => q(rw), isa => q(HashRef[Archive::File]) );

=pod

=head3 get_filename()

Returns the filename of the archive

sub get_filename { return shift->filename; }

#### end Package 'Archive' ####

=pod

=head2 Package Archive::Diff

This file takes two L<Archive> objects as arguments, and when queried using
the object methods, will return a formatted list that shows the differences in
the contents of the two archives.

has q(first) => ( is => q(rw), isa => q(Archive), required => 1 );
has q(second) => ( is => q(rw), isa => q(Archive), required => 1 );

=pod

=head3 simple_diff()

Shows a simple comparison, whether or not a file is in one archive or the
other.

=head3 full_diff()

Shows not only if files are in one archive but not another, but if the same
file in both archives differs in timestamp or uncompressed size.

=cut

sub simple_diff {
	my $self = shift;
	my $first = $self->first;
	my $second = $self->second;

	print qq(The first filename is ) . $first->filename . qq(\n);
	print qq(The second filename is ) . $second->filename . qq(\n);
} # sub simple_diff

#### end Package 'Archive::Diff' ####

=pod 

=head2 Package Archive::Attributes

Contains metadata attributes for an archive file.  

=over 5

=item version

The version of the program that created this archive.  May or may not come from
the archive itself;  a asterisk B<*> denotes the version number of the program
on the system, as the archive itÑ•elf does not hold any version information.

=back

=cut

#### Package 'Archive::Attributes' ####
package Archive::Attributes;
use Moose;
use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;

has q(version) => ( is => q(rw), isa => q(Str) );

#### end Package 'Archive::Attributes' ####

=pod 

=head2 Package Archive::File

An object that holds information about a file in an archive.  You would most
likely create as many L<Archive::File> objects as you had individual files and
directories in an archive.  L<Archive::File> has the following attributes:

=over 5 

=item name

The name of the file that is a member of this L<Archive>.

=item timestamp

The timestamp of the file as stored in the archive.

=item  orig_size

The uncompressed size of the file stored in the archive.

=item attributes

The attributes stored with the file in the archive.

=back

=cut

use Moose;
use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;

has q(timestamp) => ( is => q(rw), isa => q(Str) );
has q(usize) => ( is => q(rw), isa => q(Str) );
has q(attributes) => ( is => q(rw), isa => q(Str) );
