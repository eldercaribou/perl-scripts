: Advanced Color Logs configuration file

: Colors -- black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, default
: Attributes -- <none>, bright, blinking, underlined, normal, 
:               background, beep, hide
: 
: Format for this file is 
: [ATTRIBUTE(S)]COLOR,primary_match[,secondary_match,...]
:
: attributes can be any ordering of the above attributes. This field is not
:    case sensitive; only one color may be used. 
: primary_match must be a positive match (must be in line)
: secondary_match(es) can be positive or negative (must NOT be in line)
: negative matches are specified by NOT ('!')
:
: EXAMPLE - 
: Display red background text when there someone other than "nobody" opens
:     an su session.  Note the log entry has (su) so we want to match to
:     "(su)" to avoid matches to "superchicken" or anything else with "su".
:
: BackgroundRed,(su),opened,!nobody
:
: Matches are done linearly.  First match is the color used.  Because of this,
: list matches as most specific to most general.  Simple rule of thumb is to
: list matches in order of most number of conditionals to least number of
: conditionals.

: Named.  The inspiration for this program.  Ignore status messages.
: These rules are ordered so expected "abnormality" messages such

: messages which are not one of these "abnormality" messages and
: are not a "status" message is given background colorizing so we
: notice them easily, then status messages are ignored.

: Identd.  I don't really care about this, but I do want to
: know when it's requested.  Up top, I made identd show in
: normal color.  Here, I'm going to make the actual message
: text dark (bright black is really dark grey)
BrightBlack, identd


: With this colourization scheme, other messages, which are displayed
: in the normal colour of white on black, are actually highlighted
: quite nicely.  If too many messages appear that way, though, try to
: seperate them out into colours.
